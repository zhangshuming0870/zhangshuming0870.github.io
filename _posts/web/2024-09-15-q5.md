react-dom-client.development.js:6698 Uncaught Error: Invalid hook call. Hooks can only be called inside of the body of a function component. This could happen for one of the following reasons:
1. You might have mismatching versions of React and the renderer (such as React DOM)
2. You might be breaking the Rules of Hooks
3. You might have more than one copy of React in the same app



## 环境
- nextjs
- react
- typescript

useEffect 被放在了组件外部，这违反了 React Hooks 的规则

## 将useEffect 放入react组件内
